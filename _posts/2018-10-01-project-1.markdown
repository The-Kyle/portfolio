description: Inspired by local Meetup by ShiftKey Labs, I tried to implement simple minesweeper game by ReactJS, with in-class understandings at NSCC. This side-project significantly enhanced my understandings of ReactJS and modern JavaScript libraries. Used tools includes - NodeJS, VisualStudio Code, create-react-app. Online demo can be reached at <a href="https://the-kyle.github.io/minesweeper/" target="_blank">Minesweeper_on_Github</a>.
